      <h1>Aarya Chaumal</h1>
      <p>I lived in Rasayani.</p>
      <p>I now live in Pune for studies.</p>
      <p>I read comic books and have a pretty big collection and also watch anime.</p>
      <p>I watch a lot of movies.</p>
      <p>I write <a href = "http://www.github.com/light2802" >code</a> and occasionally write <a href = "." >blogs</a> about the random thoughts I get.</p>
      <p>I am a final year student at <a href = "http://www.coep.org.in/" >College of Engineering Pune (CoEP)</a>.</p>
      <p>I am very interested in core Computer Science topics like Computer Architecture, Operating Systems and Networks</p>
      <p>I am kind of a math-fanatic :)</p>
      <p>I appreciate the math behind AI and ML but I'm not sure if I want to make my career in it.</p>
      <p>I am a member of On-Board Computer subsystem at <a href = "https://www.coep.org.in/csat/about-us/">CSAT</a>.</p>
      <p>I have a more detailed <a href="./Resume.pdf">résumé</a> if you're into that sort of thing.</p>
      <p>I am just a curious kid always ready to learn more.</p>
